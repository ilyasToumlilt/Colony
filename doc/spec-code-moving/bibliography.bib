@article{Shapiro2011-back,
abstract = {Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable
shared object converge without foreground synchronisation. Previous approaches
to eventual consistency are ad-hoc and error-prone. We study a principled
approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal
conditions that are sufficient to guarantee eventual consistency. We call
these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). This
paper formalises asynchronous object replication, either state based or
operation based, and provides a sufficient condition appropriate for each
case. It describes several useful CRDTs, including container data types
supporting both $\backslash$add and $\backslash$remove operations with clean
semantics, and more complex types such as graphs, montonic DAGs, and
sequences. It discusses some properties needed to implement non-trivial
CRDTs.},

@misc{Du2013,
abstract = {Clock-SI is a fully distributed protocol that implements$\backslash$nsnapshot isolation (SI) for partitioned data stores. It$\backslash$nderives snapshot and commit timestamps from loosely$\backslash$nsynchronized clocks, rather than from a centralized$\backslash$ntimestamp authority as used in current systems. A$\backslash$ntransaction obtains its snapshot timestamp by reading the$\backslash$nclock at its originating partition and Clock-SI provides$\backslash$nthe corresponding consistent snapshot across all the$\backslash$npartitions. In contrast to using a centralized timestamp$\backslash$nauthority, Clock-SI has availability and performance$\backslash$nbenefits: It avoids a single point of failure and a$\backslash$npotential performance bottleneck, and improves$\backslash$ntransaction latency and throughput. We develop an$\backslash$nanalytical model to study the trade-offs introduced by$\backslash$nClock-SI among snapshot age, delay probabilities of$\backslash$ntransactions, and abort rates of update transactions. We$\backslash$nverify the model predictions using a system$\backslash$nimplementation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the$\backslash$nperformance benefits of Clock-SI experimentally using a$\backslash$nmicro-benchmark and an application-level benchmark on a$\backslash$npartitioned key-value store. For short read-only$\backslash$ntransactions, Clock-SI improves latency and throughput by$\backslash$n50{\%} by avoiding communications with a centralized$\backslash$ntimestamp authority. With a geographically partitioned$\backslash$ndata store, Clock-SI reduces transaction latency by more$\backslash$nthan 100 milliseconds. Moreover, the performance benefits$\backslash$nof Clock-SI come with higher availability.},
